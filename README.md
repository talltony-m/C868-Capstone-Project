# C868-Capstone-Project
My BS Software Development Capstone Project Application, written in C# and uses an external MySQL db. This project has two main areas, a team roster and a team schedule area. The schedule area uses a MySQL Database to store the team and schedule information. The roster area stores the "inventory" locally. The program has log in security and tests for cultural information to detect American English or French Canadian, and the log in page changes languages, based on that. Various user input validation and application exception checks are part of the program. In the schedule area, all DateTime informaiton is coverted to UTC before being stored in the MySQL database and coverted to local time when read, so that the users can be in different time zones and get the correct local time. A log in report is stored locally, so folder write permissions on the PC need to be set, so that the application can write to the local file. Three reports are available in the scheduling area. This application of almost 1600 lines of code, along with a 42 page development plan and user manual. I received a passing score.
